# Tinkers_balancing
A simple datapack made to balance some materials added by addons for [Tinkers Construct 3.1.3.271 (1.16)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tinkers-construct), and add some other small features
To work, this datapack requires the addon [Materialis 2.1.1](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/materialis)
It may work with later versions of these two mods, but it may also not work. Hic sunt dracones.
