# Tinkers_balancing
A simple datapack made to balance some materials added by addons for [Tinkers Construct 3.1.3.271 (1.16)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tinkers-construct), and add some other small features
To work, this datapack requires the addon [Materialis 2.1.1](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/materialis)
It may work with later versions of these two mods, but it may also not work

There are two versions of this: the normal and the +compat
They are mostly the same, with the exeption than the +compat version add compatibility between different mods adding materials, so that some materials don't end up being exact copies of each other, or filling the same niche
For now, the only materials in that case are Rose Quartz from [Create](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create) and Rosenquartz from [Tinker's Delight](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tinkers-delight)
